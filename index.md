## Welcome to... my ramblings

This started because I found something cool when doing work with Python that I couldn't share anywhere. So I figured I'll make my own place to share stuff.

Eventually I'll add interactive stuff but for now pretty much everything is manual because I don't think it's possible to add interactive content using Markdown (but I could be entirely wrong).

And now since you're here...

## My projects

- [Flag Finder](https://github.com/kodcdangky/Flag-finder): A GUI Python program made with the tkinter library. Fetch and displays flag of any country that is on Wikipedia's list. Also caches them so you can use them for your own purpose.

- [Periodic Timer](https://github.com/kodcdangky/Periodic-Timer): Another GUI Python program made with [PySimpleGUI](https://github.com/PySimpleGUI/PySimpleGUI). A timer program which automatically and continuously loops for anything that requires an interval timing.

- [Generalized Connect X bot](https://github.com/kodcdangky/Generalized-Connect-X-bot): A bot which plays any generalized version of the game Connect Four using depth-limited minimax algorithm with modified alpha-beta pruning. Comes with a game program made with [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/news) for demonstration purpose.
